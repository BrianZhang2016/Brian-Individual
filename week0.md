Dopamine is a real issue. It is even depicted in myself as well. For example, during finals week, I see myself spend more time playing video games rather than studying for my final. This is because I gain dopamine as I go online and play video games with my friends.

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

They are many ways people could empower themselves on the internet. An example of this could be that using the internet provides unlimited information. With this in mind, people could just go online and find any information they want, which empowers them.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

A way someone who's empowered could help someone who isn't could be that they educate them. For example, they could write a book or just teach them through lectures. A way I could do this at Del Norte HS is to gain some knowledge on certain information and spread them to other people. 

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

There is definitely red tape preventing digital empowerment, such as access to the internet, access to technology, etc. There is even red tape at Del Norte HS such as website restrictions. Red tape is practically everywhere as it's definition is "Blockage or regulation"
