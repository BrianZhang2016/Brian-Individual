1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?

No, This is because the computer only does what it's been programmed to do. Because of this the programmer probably forgot to add the variety of skin colors

2. How do you think this happened?

I think this occured because the programmer failed to test on darker toned skin colors

3. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?

This bug is indeed harmful; however, it wasn't intended to be harmful or exclude individuals.

4. Should it be corrected?

It's should be corrected inorder to everyone to be equal and not feel discriminated.

5. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

I would test everything first before officially publishing it to the public. This way, there would only be better outcome. If the current outcomes weren't disirable, I would change it so it could better fit people's desires.
