## Requirements:
* Input and an Output
* At least one list
* At least one procedure
* At least one algorithm

## Idea:
### Simon Says in our "Our Games" tab
Using Javascript

Input: User repeats selected colors after computer randomly generates color

Output: If the selected color is correct player gets a point and a new color is generated

List: The four different colors chosen at random will be stored inside a list (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green)

Procedure: If the user gets the color right, the user gains 1 point. If the user gets color wrong, the game ends. There is also a procedure to generate and add a random color to the line of color to be repeated.

Algorithm)

Sequencing: First, code generates random color, next it awaits user input to repeat the randomly generated color, then it adds a random color

Selection: If user repeated the colors perfectly, add new random color. Else games ends

Iteration: Repeats the previous colors before adding a new random one.
