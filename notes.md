## TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1
Drones: Beneficial: can deliver things. Harmful: can used to spy on people (Trespass private property) 

Dopamine: Pleasure. Video games, Social media, etc.

### Github Pages Action 
**Beneficial:**
* Access to unlimited information
* Used for many entertainment
* Can be used for shopping

**Harmful:**
* Harm people's mental health
* Additcted to the internet
* Online Attacks

Dopamine is a real issue. It is even depicted in myself as well. For example, during finals week, I see myself spend more time playing video games rather than studying for my final. This is because I gain dopamine as I go online and play video games with my friends.

## TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2
Digital Divide: Not having the access to digital devices

Top Companies has technology

Red tape: Blocking, Some sort of rule. Blocks you from the main goal (Have to fins another way). EX: School wifi.

### Github Pages Action
They are many ways people could empower themselves on the internet. An example of this could be that using the internet provides unlimited information. With this in mind, people could just go online and find any information they want, which empowers them.

A way someone who's empowered could help someone who isn't could be that they educate them. For example, they could write a book or just teach them through lectures. A way I could do this at Del Norte HS is to gain some knowledge on certain information and spread them to other people. 

There is definitely red tape preventing digital empowerment, such as access to the internet, access to technology, etc. There is even red tape at Del Norte HS such as website restrictions. Red tape is practically everywhere as it's definition is "Blockage or regulation"
