## TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.5
Patent: Shows ownership. Can make money

Licence and Patent could have conflict. Licence that contains things from a Patent.

Free and open source: Freedom to edit and change it online. Less restriction

Licence: could be free or restricted to make money off of it. (Talk to sponsor about it)
* GPL Licence: If copied thing is free, what you release off the copy has to be free

### Github Page Action
1.When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

MIT Licence:
* Anyone could edit software
* Commercial Use
* Distributes closed code versions
* Creater of code has no responsibility on what others do to it

GPL Licence:
* Anyone could edit software
* Patent Use
* Other people who used the original code MUST show where the code originated from
* Changes to the code must be documented

2.Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

I chosed a MIT licence for my individual page and Team Project. This is because I believe that I wouldn't come back to this code after the school year has ended.

## TPT 2.0 Safe Computing 5.6
PII: Personal Identifiable Information

This that can go wrong with computing:
* Leaked information
* IP Address
* Malware
* Identity Theft
* Stalking
* Credit card information

Solution:
* 2 Factor Authentication

(Recommend Watch College Board 5.6 Video 2)

### Github Page Action
1.Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

I have seen PII in my current team project. For example, the contact us page. This page in our website contains information about my teammates emails as well as our sponsors email.

2.What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

I personally feel that having my PII exposed could cause me harm, like my IP address. Yet there are some information that I'm fine with sharing like my personal name.

3.Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

A good password would contain uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, symbols, and just a password that isn't easily guessed

A bad password would be short and predictable. EX: 123456 or password

Another step to assist in authentication would be having 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) or adding a sign in question to ensure that it is acutally you who is signing in.

4.Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

Symmetric Encription: A key that can both encrypts and decrypts information

Asymmetric Encription: Two keys. One used for encrypting and one for decrypting information

5.Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment

An example of encryption in deployment is when we need to update our website to the newest version. When we update the website, it would ask us to provide a password in order to keep the data of the website sacred.

6.Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

A phishing scheme that occured to me made a bot sign into my account and started messaging everyone I know with the same message that hacked my account. I quickly changed my password with stopped it from sending messages to people. Another phishing technique could be sending people emails about them winning a award and that they just need to provide some infomation in order to redeem it.
